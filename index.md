# Privacy Policy for Hajj App

## Introduction
Our privacy policy explains what information we collect at Hajj App, how we use it, and the choices you have. Hajj App is a free application provided at no cost and intended for use as is. By using our Service, you agree to the collection and use of information as described in this policy. The Personal Information we collect is used solely to provide and improve the Service. We will not use or share your information except as outlined in this Privacy Policy. Terms used here have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, accessible within the Hajj App, unless otherwise defined.

## Information Collection and Use
To enhance your experience with our Service, we may collect certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to:
* Name
* Email address
* Gender
* Pictures
* Travel information
* Passport details
* Emergency contact information
* Health information (where relevant for Hajj services)
* Hajj-specific preferences (e.g., participation in rituals or preferred routes)

This information is retained and used to facilitate your Hajj experience, such as providing guidance for Hajj rituals, coordinating with groups, or ensuring safety. The app provides location and direction information for Hajj sites (e.g., Arafat, Mina, Kaaba) and nearby facilities without tracking your location. The app may use third-party services (e.g., for mapping or analytics), but these services do not collect or process location data or track user movements.

## Cookies
Cookies are small data files used as anonymous unique identifiers, sent to your browser or stored on your deviceâ€™s internal memory. This Service does not explicitly use cookies. However, third-party code and libraries may use cookies to collect non-identifying information and improve their services. You can accept or refuse these cookies and will be notified when a cookie is sent. Refusing cookies may limit access to some features of the Service.

## Location Information
Hajj App does not collect or track location information from your device. Instead, the app provides static or user-initiated information about Hajj ritual sites, directions, and nearby facilities (e.g., hospitals, accommodations) to support your Hajj experience. This information is accessed without requiring real-time or background location data from your device.

## Device Information
We may collect limited device information to enhance service quality and prevent fraud. This information does not identify individual users and is not used for tracking purposes.

## Service Providers
We engage third-party companies and individuals to:
* Facilitate our Service
* Provide the Service on our behalf
* Perform Service-related tasks (e.g., mapping, analytics)
* Analyze Service usage

These third parties may access your Personal Information to perform assigned tasks but are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. No location tracking data is shared with third parties, as the app does not collect such data.

## Security
We prioritize protecting your Personal Information using commercially acceptable methods. However, no internet transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Children's Privacy
This Service is not intended for individuals under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we discover such information has been provided, we will delete it immediately. Parents or guardians aware of such instances should contact us.

## Religious Data Privacy
Hajj App respects the sensitive nature of religious data. Information related to your participation in Hajj rituals or preferences is collected solely to enhance your Hajj experience (e.g., providing ritual guidance or route suggestions). This data is not used for marketing or shared with unaffiliated third parties without your explicit consent.

## International Data Transfer
As Hajj occurs in Saudi Arabia, your information may be transferred to and processed on servers located outside your jurisdiction, where data protection laws may differ. By providing information, you consent to its transfer to and processing in Saudi Arabia for Hajj-related purposes.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Changes will be posted on this page and take effect immediately. We encourage you to review this page regularly for updates.
