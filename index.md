Privacy Policy for Hajj App
Introduction
Our privacy policy explains what information we collect at Hajj App, how we use it, and the choices you have. Hajj App is a free application provided at no cost and intended for use as is. By using our Service, you agree to the collection and use of information as described in this policy. The Personal Information we collect is used solely to provide and improve the Service. We will not use or share your information except as outlined in this Privacy Policy. Terms used here have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, accessible within the Hajj App, unless otherwise defined.
Information Collection and Use
To enhance your experience with our Service, we may collect certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to:

Name
Email address
Gender
Location (including real-time location during Hajj season)
Pictures
Travel information
Passport details
Emergency contact information
Health information (where relevant for Hajj services)
Hajj-specific data (e.g., participation in rituals, locations visited, and navigation directions)

This information is retained and used as described in this policy to facilitate your Hajj experience, including navigation, safety, and coordination during the Hajj season. The app uses third-party services that may collect information to identify you, such as mapping or analytics providers, to support these features.
Cookies
Cookies are small data files used as anonymous unique identifiers, sent to your browser or stored on your deviceâ€™s internal memory. This Service does not explicitly use cookies. However, third-party code and libraries may use cookies to collect information and improve their services. You can accept or refuse these cookies and will be notified when a cookie is sent. Refusing cookies may limit access to some features of the Service.
Location Information
We collect location information, including real-time data from your mobile device, to provide Hajj-specific services, such as:

Navigating to Hajj ritual sites (e.g., Arafat, Mina, Kaaba)
Providing directions to nearby facilities and services
Locating group members during Hajj rituals
Offering emergency assistance
Tracking movement for safety and coordination during Hajj season

Location data is collected only with your explicit consent and used solely for the purposes listed above. We do not store location data beyond the Hajj season unless required for safety or legal compliance.
Device Information
We may collect device information to enhance service quality and prevent fraud. This information does not identify individual users and is used to ensure the app functions effectively.
Service Providers
We engage third-party companies and individuals to:

Facilitate our Service
Provide the Service on our behalf
Perform Service-related tasks (e.g., mapping, analytics)
Analyze Service usage

These third parties may access your Personal Information to perform assigned tasks but are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. For example, location data may be shared with mapping providers to deliver navigation services or with emergency services for safety purposes.
Security
We prioritize protecting your Personal Information using commercially acceptable methods. However, no internet transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
Children's Privacy
This Service is not intended for individuals under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we discover such information has been provided, we will delete it immediately. Parents or guardians aware of such instances should contact us.
Religious Data Privacy
Hajj App respects the sensitive nature of religious data. Information related to your participation in Hajj rituals, preferences, or movements during Hajj is collected solely to enhance your Hajj experience (e.g., navigation, coordination, or safety). This data is not used for marketing or shared with unaffiliated third parties without your explicit consent.
International Data Transfer
As Hajj occurs in Saudi Arabia, your information may be transferred to and processed on servers located outside your jurisdiction, where data protection laws may differ. By providing information, you consent to its transfer to and processing in Saudi Arabia for Hajj-related purposes.
Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Changes will be posted on this page and take effect immediately. We encourage you to review this page regularly for updates.
